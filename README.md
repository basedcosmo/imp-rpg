IMP is a basic role playing, from my friends gathering around a table with 6d6 and a 1d12, and playing a roleplaying game I made up.

What followed, at the time of writing this, what followed is 1000 lines of code worth of time to make the experience better for myself and my friends. In this program, you can find a Character Generator, Map Viewer, Spell Codex, Enemy Lists, and more, all for your use, if you choose to play this game. The rules are simple. Make a character. Spell rules are whatever you want them to be, rolls must be UNDER your stat, by the roll of d12. Damage is usually on a 1d6 - 4d6 scale. Have fun, kill monsters, get loot, and don't die.
